# P6-Board-Game

This is the sixth project of my path with OpenClassroom.

The point here, is to practice jQueryand O.O. Javascript by creating a little board game, two players plays, one after another.

They must have the following functionalities :

- A player can move up to three cell if it's not a blocked path (random number of these each time you play)
- A player can choose to shoot another one if he is on the cell directly next to him
- Or a player can choose to protect himself instead to avoid 50% damage on next turn
- A player must pick up a weapon if he walk on it, differents weapons spawns randomly on the board
- If a player die, the other one win (of course) and a victory message appear (hurrayyyy !)
